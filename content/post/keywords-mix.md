I got recently caught up with the paper work and came accross some fun notes from years ago! Couldn't wait to share this contextual keywords mix, the courtesy of [@v2_matveev](https://twitter.com/v2_matveev):

{{< highlight java >}}
partial class where<partial> where partial: where<partial>
{
	dynamic dynamic<yield>(dynamic dynamic)
	{
		return dynamic<yield>(dynamic);
	}
}
{{< /highlight >}}  

Yes, it compiles :)
