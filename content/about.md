### About me

I'm Natallie Baikevich, asymptotically statistician, allocations hunter and mountains admirer 
who happened to find herself in ZÃ¼rich together with a mix of F#, CUDA C and Python.
Interested in all things performance and correctness.

Whether you have any questions, want to chat about anything from programming languages to machine learning or up for a crazy hike - let me know!

### About the blog 

This blog is a collections of the pseudo-random thoughts in pseudo-random moments of time, which - I hope - include some useful tips and discoveries... or just something that bothered me enough to write about :)
